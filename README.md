....Some Boring Story....

When I look back after finishing this project, I realise it was about __25 June 2021__ when I had the thought to employ my skills in something beneficial. Then, beginning from the ground up, I watched YouTube tutorials and several websites to learn how to write, create, and deploy a website. and after so many frustrating fruitless attempts and failed programmes, I am finally here with my _First Successful Project_. 20 January 2022, I am ready with my portfolio website. I'd want to thank God for providing me with the insight and knowledge I needed to complete, as well as my friends and everyone who helped me get here. During this journey I learned __"Sometimes Giving Breaks can lead to BIGGER Jumps"__
